Audit Databases
===============

This script will loop through all the content databases for all SharePoint web applications and display information about content databases reside on a chosen SQL server. This is useful if you have a large number of content databases across multiple SQL servers, and need to quickly determine what content databases reside on a particular server rather than manually looking through Central Administration or SQL Server Management Studio.

Replace SERVERYOUARELOOKINGFOR with the netbios or FQDN of the SQL server.
