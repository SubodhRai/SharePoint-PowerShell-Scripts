List URL, Primary Owner, and Secondary Owner
--------------------------------------------
This script will ask for the URL of a Web Application. It will loop through each Site Collection inside it and report:
	The Site Collection URL.
	The Primary Administrator of the Site Collection.
	The Secondary Administrator of the Site Collection.

The data will be placed in a file called SiteCollectionReport.txt

There is also a simplified version of this script that just outputs data to PowerShell's window.
